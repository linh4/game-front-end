### Game Rule:
- The computer plays a pattern and the user have to repeat it back in order.
- User can play until he/she quits or time runs out.
- The more levels user can play, the higher he/she is in the leaderboard.
- Use mouse clicks, arrow keys, WASD, or IJKL to control the top, left, bottom, and right icons respectively.

```
bundle install
