# Tic-Tap-Tone Game

### Game Rule:
- The computer plays a pattern and the user have to repeat it back in order.
- User can play until he/she quits or time runs out.
- The more levels user can play, the higher he/she is in the leaderboard.
- Use mouse clicks, arrow keys, WASD, or IJKL to control the top, left, bottom, and right icons respectively.

### Run the game:
First, run back-end:
```
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rails s
```
Then, open browser to play the game:
```
open index.html
```

### Future Plans:
- User can change timer
- User can choose different modes
